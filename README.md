# Predictive-Models
Here is a project I'm building for the class "Foundation of Predictive Models" where we need to predict the price of a house. The dataset we use to train the model needed to be analyzed and cleaned 
Then we separated the dataset to train(80%) the model and then to test it(20%). It is an ongoing project so It will be changed and managed several times.
